# PyBer_Analysis
Analysis of the company PyBer using Python-Pandas and Matplotlib

## Overview
PyBer is a ride -sharing app company, and to help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods, we have created  several types of visualizations and showcased the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city. We also analyze how the data differs by city type.

## Results
Based on our summary chart we can notice that the rural cities have less drivers and for this reason, the average fares are more expensive, and since there is more demand for rides on urban cities this makes fare costs to be lower.

In our line chart we can visualize that at the beginning of the year there is a decrease of rides, but our highest demand on all types of cities is in the last two weeks of February.

## Summary 

Our recommendations to address some of the disparities are, 
- For the rural cities lower costs on the weekdays and some weekends as promotion, to increase amount of rides. 
- Increase the amount of drivers on the suburban cities to lower cost of ride.
- Increase the cost of urban cities on weekends.
